# For developers

Download the bedrock dedicated server and cd into it then run

```git clone https://github.com/FeatherUtils/EssentialsV.git```

Then run `cd EssentialsV` and then run `npm install`

Once you did that run `npm run watch` and it'll copy all the files from BP/ and RP/ to development_behavior_packs and development_resource_packs
